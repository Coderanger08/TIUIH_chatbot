# ü§ñ TIU Impact Hub Chatbot ‚Äî AI Access Control with Permit.io

A smart chatbot built for **Tokyo International University‚Äôs Impact Hub** ‚Äî a student-led community focused on innovation, entrepreneurship, and global collaboration.

This chatbot uses **Gemini AI** to answer questions *only* about TIU Impact Hub, while **Permit.io** provides secure, role-based access to protected actions like sending mass emails to members.

---

## üéØ Why This Matters

Student organizations often need automation ‚Äî but with *authorization*. This project shows how you can:
- Safely integrate AI into community websites
- Prevent misuse of AI-powered actions (like mass emails or server posts)
- Apply fine-grained **access control using Permit.io**
